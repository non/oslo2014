This is a talk I gave at [flatMap(Oslo) 2014](http://flatmap.no).

You can see read [presentation](oslo2014.pdf) or see the underlying
[markdown](presentation.md) I used.

The full compiling code can be read at [oslo.scala](oslo.scala).

I did take some liberties in the presentation to try to remove some
boilerplate and unnecessary complexity.
